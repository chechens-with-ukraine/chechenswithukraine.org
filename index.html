<h2 class="focus">To the people of Ukraine</h2>

<p><span class="focus">
  The Chechen people stand with you.
</span></p>

<p>The times are dark, and watching the war unfold, the same way it unfolded in Chechnya over two decades ago, brings memories of indescribable pain. We remember the bodies in our streets, the sound of bombs terrorising our children, the constant threat of torture, of rape, of death.</p>

<p><span class="focus">We have gone through this horror</span>, we remember it all, and watching it happen again breaks our hearts.</p>

<p><span class="focus">But there is hope</span>. The brave resistance of your people, the unshakeable will of your leaders, the overwhelming support from the entire world. Seeing your heroism against the same person who murdered our families and destroyed our lives, we allow ourselves to feel hope.</p>

<p>We share in your sorrows, because we have lived through them, and we join in your joys, because they show us that it doesn’t have to be the way it was. We also feel <span class="focus">an unbearable shame</span>: the armed forces of our occupied country are today fighting on the side of Russia. Against Ukraine, and against the Chechen volunteers who have been fighting at Ukraine’s side for the last 8 years. But we hope that you will recognise Chechens in the bravery of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dzhokhar_Dudayev_Battalion">Dzhokhar Dudayev Battalion</a> rather than in Kadyrov’s treachery, and that you will continue seeing our two peoples as brothers.</p>

<p>Know that you are not alone. <span class="focus">Sisters, brothers, we stand with you.</span></p>

<p><span class="focus">Today, we are Ukrainian.</span></p>

<h3 class="focus">Слава Україні!</h3>

<h2 class="focus">To the Chechen people</h2>

<p>Many of us are fighting in Ukraine today as volunteers, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dzhokhar_Dudayev_Battalion">Adam Osmayev</a>, but the shadow cast upon us by 12,000 of Kadyrov’s soldiers is too great.</p>

<p>Most Chechen soldiers in Ukraine have no choice but to go to war. Most Chechens in Chechnya have no choice but to remain silent. Russian citizens are bravely demonstrating and voicing their refusal of war, despite the risk of prison, but going against Kadyrov in Chechnya is a death sentence for your loved ones. The result is that our countrymen are fighting against one of the only countries who spoke out against Russia when we ourselves were being killed.</p>

<p>But many of us, those who grew up as refugees, those whose families have managed to flee the genocide and the tyranny, can still act.</p>

<p><span class="focus">It is our responsibility as human beings, and as people who have lived through the same horror, wrought by the same enemy.</span></p>

<p><span class="focus">It is our only chance, not of changing the past, but of giving it meaning.</span> Remember what we went through. Remember the 200,000 dead in the Chechen Wars. Remember the hundreds of thousands of refugees. Remember the deportations and genocides before that. Can you stay silent when the children of people killed by Russia yesterday are today killing for Russia? Can you let an entire people go down in history as traitors? A people once respected for its struggle for freedom would today be known for betrayal and inaction?</p>

<p>One day, it will be our turn to fight and seek freedom, once again. Who will come to our help? Will our Ukraine sisters and brothers come? Will anyone support us?</p>

<p><span class="focus">Rise, Chechens! Today, we help Ukraine avoid the suffering that we’ve been living with all of our lives.</span></p>

<p>Do not let our honour as a people be forever tarnished by the actions of two dictators. We will never be able to wash this shame.</p>

<p>Show our brothers and sisters in Ukraine that Chechens are with them.</p>

<p><span class="focus">Share your support for Ukraine and show Ukrainians that they have an ally.</span>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><span class="focus">Call your relatives back</span> in Chechnya and tell them to do whatever they can to avoid sending our countrymen to Ukraine. They will be in danger, but they will save their sons from dying in Ukraine.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="focus">Go to demonstrations</span> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protests_against_the_2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine#Outside_Russia">the countries that you now live in</a> and let the flag of Ichkeria join the flags of Ukraine, of Syria, of Georgia, of Azerbaijan, of Afghanistan.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="focus">Donate</span> to the charity <a href="https://savelife.in.ua/donate/">Come Back Alive (Повернись живим)</a>, who provides support to the Ukrainian armed forces, including the Chechen battalion, donate to the <a href="https://bank.gov.ua/en/news/all/natsionalniy-bank-vidkriv-spetsrahunok-dlya-zboru-koshtiv-na-potrebi-armiyi">armed forces directly</a>, donate to <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/kyivindependent-launch">Kyiv Independent</a>, who keeps the world informed about the reality of war in Ukraine. Or donate to any of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/s6g5un/want_to_support_ukraine_heres_a_list_of_charities/">these other charities</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="focus">Call upon the leaders of our diaspora</span> and make them carry our message: <em>we stand with Ukrainians and everyone needs to do their part</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Tweet your support with the hashtags <span class="focus">#ChechensWithUkraine</span> and <span class="focus">#StopRussianInvasion</span>: your tweets will all be embedded on this website, so that our support can be seen by all.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?button_hashtag=ChechensWithUkraine&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" class="twitter-hashtag-button" data-show-count="false">#ChechensWithUkraine</a><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></li>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="focus">Call your friends in Russia</span>, tell them what is happening, ask them to protest against the war: getting information in Russia about the war is hard.</p>

  <li><span class="focus">Be active in online communities</span> like <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Chechnya/">r/Chechnya</a> against Russian misinformation.</li>
</ul>

<p>And pass this message along to as many people as you can.</p>
